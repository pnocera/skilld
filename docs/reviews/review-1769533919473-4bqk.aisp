  ;; Summary
  summary≜"The implementation of the `adviser` tool demonstrates excellent conformance to the Dynamic Protocol-Based Adviser Design specification. All removed concepts have been properly eliminated, the new file-based injection mechanism is correctly implemented, separation of concerns between Agent Layer and Skill Layer is maintained, and SKILL.md accurately documents the usage. The implementation successfully transforms the adviser from a static, task-type-bound tool into a dynamic, protocol-driven universal adviser as intended by the design."
