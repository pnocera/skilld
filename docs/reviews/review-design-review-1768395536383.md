# DESIGN REVIEW Review

**Date:** 2026-01-14T12:58:56.383Z

## Summary

No design document was provided for analysis. Only the context label "Test design doc" was received, which appears to be a placeholder rather than actual design documentation. Without the design document content, a comprehensive architectural critique cannot be performed.

## Issues (1)

### 🔴 CRITICAL
No design document content provided - only a placeholder label was received
**Location:** N/A
**Recommendation:** Provide the actual design document text or file path to enable analysis

## Suggestions

Share the design document directly in the chat as text
Provide a file path to the design document if it exists in the codebase
Include any diagrams, specifications, or architectural drawings relevant to the design
Specify what aspects of the system the design should cover (e.g., data models, API contracts, system architecture)
If testing the review process, provide sample design documentation to validate the output format
